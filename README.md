# Jaded Prints

## What is it?
Jaded Prints was a business project of mine. I had an idea, and wanted to make it a reality so I did it. We sold album art inspired posters. Over the course of a few months, I put together a backend and frontend responsive e-commerce website to sell the posters. I could've made the website with Shopify or something similar, but I enjoy the technical aspect of business and development. 

## The Technical Side
Jaded Prints was put together using a variety of technologies. Mainly Stripe Payment Processor, NodeJS, Google Analytics, React, TailwindCSS, Figma, DigitalOcean, Express, and plenty of others to aid me along the way. I thorougly enjoyed the project and think it's one of my best pieces of work. The site is still live at https://www.jadedprints.com, however I've disabled the associated Stripe account as I no longer wish to sell the posters - unfortunately, I don't have the passion for marketing as I do software engineering.

Feel free to contact me with any questions.

Thanks for reading.
